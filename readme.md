a way to use discord when your connection is bad.
Webapp hosted on intermediary server that selectively makes discord packets smaller.
Client and server use clever localstorage syncronization and tricks to prevent unnecessary loading.
Server packages: discord.py-self, flask, flask-socketio, flask-cors, threading, asyncio
Client packages: None! just go to the site (not yet public)
